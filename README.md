# Belly-button-challenge

For this challenge, an interactive dashboard was built for the purpose of exploring the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset 
which can be found at: http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/. This dataset reveals that a small handful of 
microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) are present in more than 70% of people, while 
the rest are relatively rare.

To complete the data exploration, the Plotly D3 Javascript library was used to create three visualizations for each subject in the trial. 
These visualizations are accessed via dropdown menu.

# Belly-button-challenge



Interactive dashboard was built to explore diversity of cultured bacteria from different individualsâ€™ belly buttons! 
Data set link : http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/. 

This dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) 
are present in more than 70% of people, while the rest are relatively rare.

These visualizations are accessed via dropdown menu, which is created with Javascipt.
Each option provides information of the individual- i:e: Age, Gender, Ethnicity etc...
Three visualisation is built for each subject - Bar and Bubble chart and a guage to display the washing frequency.
